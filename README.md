# granatus-slow

This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. It includes updates related to the item transmutation glitch. This version has been slightly modified for using standard movements (no movement-based glitches such as windbomb, BLSS, or BTB).
