# granatus-slow

This is a route for the Breath of the Wild 100% speedrun, based on the original "Granatus" route by Johnnyboomr and updated and worked on by the speedrun community. It includes updates related to the item transmutation glitch.

This version has been modified for using standard movements (no movement-based glitches such as windbomb, BLSS, or BTB). The route is intended to prioritize the reduction of difficulty (at the cost of speed and time), and makes the following assumptions:

- For rupee printing, at the very least, shaft and spring will be chosen.
- At least two giant ancient cores will be obtained so that an ancient bow and ancient shield can be purchased. 
- Hylian Shield durability will be transferred to the ancient shield. 
- Approximately 50-60 ancient arrows will be purchased.
- All talus drops will be collected.
- The Climber's Set will be obtained and upgraded to level 2.

The fury routing is at the runner's discression. The originial routing that was in Tao's document was used, however, the runner can easily change the priority of which enemies to use it on. There will normally be plenty of time for the 12 min rechrage. For example, I use it on backside-gem talus (rather than bomb arrows), and use the Boulder Breaker for all other talus.
